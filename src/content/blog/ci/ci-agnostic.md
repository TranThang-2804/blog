## Introduction

This is my first technical blog, so it may have some errors here and 
there, so please create a ***Suggest Changes*** If you feel like changing
any part of this blog. Really appreciate it!

As a DevOps/Developer or even Tester/QA I'm pretty sure you already get use
to the term CI/CD and you may already using something like Jenkins, Gitlab 
CI, Github Action, ... But yeah you can see this blog is not just focusing on 
DevOps point of view, but rather for the experience of everyone using CI/CD
